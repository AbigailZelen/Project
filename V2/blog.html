        <h3>When Creativity Strikes</h3>

            <p>I think everyone would agree that sometimes it’s hard to find inspiration.  This is especially true for artists.  However, it’s important 
              that we keep on walking even when the desert is a dry and miserable place.  Thankfully, it can also be easy at times to feel inspired.  
              Photographers easy find inspiration when they travel, or see something super unique, but finding inspiration in places you’ve seen, your own 
              backyard, your home, or your own town is sometimes hard.
            </p>

              In September of 2019, I was luckily feeling a little inspired to take some photographs one evening.  However, I had no idea what I wanted 
              to take pictures of…So, I did what I normally would when I need a break from “real life” and I went outside.  While I was walking around 
              with my camera some flowers caught my eye.  I’ve always loved flowers, but the only plants I can keep alive are the indoor ones you only water 
              once or twice a week (oh the beauty of succulents).  My ability to keep plants alive does not affect how much I enjoy their beauty.  Most of the 
              flowers come out in the springtime, but some of my favorite flowers bloom in the late summer or fall.

              As a photographer, I can never stop thinking about different photography tricks.  Composition and focus are always given top priority, but there are 
              so many other important things such as ISO, shutter speed, F-stop, white balance, the rule of thirds and all the other tricks that photographers use to 
              make a photograph interesting.  For this photograph, I used color to make the photograph more interesting.  By using complementary colors, the subjects 
              (in this case the flowers) really stand out.  Using a color theory is a really good way to add to your photo.
