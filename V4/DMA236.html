                        <p>
                            For my final project, I'd like to create a time-lapse.  I’ll be 
                            using both time-lapse and hyper-lapse techniques to put together a 
                            cohesive video.  This time-lapse embodies my life in covid as I 
                            spend a lot of my spare time in the shop since I can’t go out and 
                            do anything.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I’ll be creating a foldable table for my laptop, so I can move 
                            and improve my current workspace.  You’ll be able to watch as I 
                            do my project step by step.  I’ll move my camera around so you can 
                            see from start to finish how I out together my project.  I’ve become 
                            slightly obsessed with my own diy projects and watching them, so I 
                            wanted to combine my love of photography and projects.

                        <h6>HDR:</h6>
                        <p>
                            For my HDR assignment, I wanted to embody what I think we're all feeling at the moment.  
                            With the stay at home order, everyone is becoming restless and eager to be free again.  
                            In an effort to save lives and flatten the curve, we've ended up spending most of our 
                            time inside. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>A Time to Reflect.</strong>  In the first photograph, there's a mirror.  The mirror displays 
                            so little and reflects what's happening now in our lives.  We know we need to somehow 
                            overcome COVID-19, but the way that's going to happen has so many variables and there 
                            are concerns no matter how we go about it.  We don't know when life will return to 
                            "normal" and what the "new normal" is going to be until then. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Feeling Down but Looking Up.</strong> The second photo embodys the feelings we have as a country.  
                            We can't hang out with many of the people we love, many of us cannot work and don't know how bills are 
                            going to be payed, people fear for their lives and the lives of people they love, I could go on and on.  
                            But, everyone's life is being effected in some way.  However, as a country we're trying to come together 
                            (by staying apart ironically) to figure out the best way to survive the virus and keep the economy from 
                            crashing any further.  Although we're upset and all struggling in different ways, we have hope as 
                            we come together.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Longing for Freedom.</strong>  The last photograph is supposed to create a longing for the 
                            outside world.  Longing, for something more than our homes, and quick trips to the grocery store on a 
                            "necessity only" basis.  It also gives us the feeling of being trapped, but also gives us a view of the 
                            outside world that someday we might be apart of again.

                            For these photographs, I went on an adventure in the small town I grew up in (Brinnon).  
                            I went underneath a bridge I had driven over many times before.
                            I found out that day, that underneath the bridge was where all the drug addicts hung out.  
                            Thus, the cigarettes, alcohol, and the needle.

                        It took about an hour and 30 minutes of my camera taking pictures, 350 ish pictures, hours trying to figure out 
                        how to put it together, hours of my computer processing images and videos, and I only have 8 seconds 
                        of video to show for it! Ha! It was pretty fun though, Enjoy!

                        <p>
                            I’ve always been intrigued by shadows, so I found this assignment really interesting and fun.  
                            I took these photographs on two different days in two different places.  
                            The first day I took some photographs at Whitney Gardens in Brinnon (an adorable little nursery. 
                            You should go if you ever have time!), and the second day I took pictures of the boardwalk in 
                            Poulsbo down by the waterfront.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have two sets of photographs, with two different feels.  
                            The first set are all photographs of shadows and wood.  
                            The second set are all photographs of shadows and concreate.

                        <h6>Motion:</h6>
                        <p>
                            For this assignment, I decided to capture the motion of water.  I love adventures, 
                            and adventures to/at waterfalls are my favorite!  When I took these photographs, it 
                            was freezing outside which really added a chill to the feeling of the photographs.  
                            Although it was a little slippery and my fingers were so red I thought they were 
                            going to fall off, I had a blast taking these.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I used many various shutter speeds
                            I used faster shutter speeds to speed make the water appear cold and uninviting.
                            Slower shutter speeds to add a feeling of being in the cold for a long period of time.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Consumer Publications (magazines):</strong>  When it comes to consumer publications, 
                            you need to do your homework and be well prepared.  You should read a few (or many) of the magazine 
                            issues to make sure your photographs will be appropriate for the magazine you’re researching.  
                            After you’ve done your research, you need to write a letter to the publication.  You’ll write a detailed 
                            cover letter that will explain why your photographs are appropriate for the magazine and send some of 
                            your work.  However, if you have a photo essay you wish to submit, you’ll send in a query letter.  A 
                            query letter is around 1 to 1 ½ pages that explains your qualifications for the photo essay, and you’ll 
                            send some jpegs of your photographs.  Make sure you find out how the magazine prefers to be contacted.  
                            If you’re written cover letter or query letter goes well, you may land an in-person interview.
                            <br />
                            <strong>Summary:</strong> Do your homework, if you’re a good fit, send in a query letter and see if you end up with an in-person interview.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Newspapers:</strong>  Something to keep in mind with newspapers are the strict deadlines.  If you miss a date, 
                            that’s it.  There are no do overs, and newspapers aren’t going to publish old news even if your 
                            photograph is a one in a million.  When applying to a newspaper, keep in mind that different papers have 
                            different qualifications.  Some newspapers still only print in black and white.  Newspapers mainly rely 
                            on their staff to provide photographs and stories, so you need to have a solid photograph/s to submit.  
                            If you have a really strong photograph, you will need to negotiate with the newspaper to be payed appropriately 
                            as newspapers don’t pay much.  However, major news event images often sell many times, so you want to make 
                            sure you’re being payed well for your work.
                            <br />
                            <strong>Summary:</strong> Do you homework, THERE ARE DEADLINES, have a strong photograph, and keep in mind that you may have to negotiate prices.  
                            The book didn’t seem to go over how to apply, but I would check out their website if they have one.

                            <strong>Trade Publications:</strong>  Trade publications are taken very seriously by both the readers and the editors.  To submit photographs 
                            to trade publications, you need to demonstrate knowledge with both your photography and techniques, but also demonstrate 
                            immense knowledge about the subject you’re photographing.  Most of the photographs from Trade publications come from stock 
                            images, but if you have skills in the particular area of the trade publication, then you can create a query and get ahold 
                            of someone to see about submitting your images.  Most of these publications buy 24 or less images a year for their issues.
                            <br />
                            <strong>Summary:</strong> Have serious knowledge on the subject, have a stellar image, and keep in mind your image needs to 
                            be amazing because trade publications don’t use many photographs (typically).  To apply, write a query and contact the trade 
                            publication to ask about submission.

                            <strong>Book Publishers:</strong>  Since publishing markets are so competitive, freelancers need to be flexible.  
                            Photographs for book publishers range from text illustrations, promotional material, images on their websites, 
                            and of course book covers.  Book publishers will either buy photographs from stock images a particular photographer 
                            might have or assign a photographer a certain task or thing to photograph.  You can submit photographs to a book 
                            publisher by sending a cover letter with some of your photographs (with list prices) and link a website if you have one.  
                            If you’re putting together a photo book, you may need to create a “dummy” book that will look almost identical to the 
                            book you’ll be publishing and send it in to a publisher.  As the book says, “It is not always necessary to be well-known 
                            to publish your photographs as a book. What you do need, however, is a unique perspective, a salable idea, and 
                            quality work.”  Larger publishers may pay more up front, however, smaller publishers typically risk more and it might be 
                            easier to get your work published.
                            <br />
                            <strong>Summary:</strong> There a many different categories for publishing your photographs when it comes to books.  
                            So, do your research and be prepared to write a cover letter, put together price lists or “dummy” books, and 
                            understand the differences between small and large publishing companies.

                            <strong>Greeting Cards, Posters & Related Products:</strong> Make sure you do your research before you attempt 
                            to have an industry turn your photographs into a greeting card, poster, etc.  After research, you can send in 
                            a query to any of the companies you’re interested in and that’d be a good fit for your work.  These kinds of 
                            companies receive so many submissions, that when they receive a query from you that states what’s available vs 
                            some of your photographs.  This way, the company will contact you acquiring to what you have available instead 
                            of being overwhelmed with photographs.  You will also stand out by being different this way.  Note: some 
                            companies require you to submit photographs, and some require a list and no photographs.  Be careful when you 
                            sell these photographs to these kinds of companies.  They will often pay higher rates, but typically along with 
                            higher rates, they buy all the rights to your images.  So, you may want to negotiate with the company to only 
                            hold the copy right for a specific time.  Some of these companies work by paying royalties. 
                            <br />
                            <strong>Summary:</strong>  Know how to stand out because it’s very common for photographers to apply to these companies.  
                            Do your research.  Understand copy rights and how the company treats copy rights.

                            <strong>Stock Photo Agencies:</strong> Stock agencies typically pay you 50 percent of the image price every time 
                            they sell your image. These kinds of companies are very competitive.

                            List of things that you should know/have before contacting a stock agency:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Have plenty of images.  You need to have way more than you send the agency because if they’re interested, 
                                    they may want to see more of your work. </li>
                                <li>Be ready to send in new images regularly.  If you don’t have an enormous photo library or you don’t take 
                                    photographs all the time, stock agencies might not be for you.</li>
                                <li>Organize your work.  Make sure your files are marked properly.  Mark files in a way that they know 
                                    what’s contained in each image.</li>
                                <li>Research, research, research, and research.  Make sure you know about the company you’re going to work for, 
                                    how they work, how big the agency is, etc.</li>
                                <li>Check and see if how the company treats their employees, and how professional they are (or not).</li>
                                <li>Once you’ve decided to apply to a stock company, contact them appropriately (usually listed on their website).  
                                    Write a short cover letter stating you’d like to send in some images.  If you hear back from the company, 
                                    DO NOT SEND YOUR ONLY ORIGINAL PHOTOGRAPHS!!  Make sure you send duplicates of your photographs, so that your 
                                    work is protected.  If you send in photographs by mail make sure you include an envelope with a stamp and 
                                    return address. </li>
                                <li>Sales on your photographs can take years, so don’t expect money right away.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br />
                            These companies can charge many fees (that might be negotiable).  Note that some of these companies require that 
                            they own exclusive rights to market your photograph (you cannot also market the same photograph).  Signing up with 
                            a stock agency may also limit your ability to work with other stock agency companies.  So, before you sign anything 
                            make sure the conditions will work with you and your needs.  Make sure you understand the contract before you sign 
                            anything, such as when your contract is renewed and how to renew or terminate it.

                            <strong>Microstock:</strong>  These companies are usually willing to work with amateur photographers.  They don’t charge their 
                            clients very much, therefore you will not receive very much money each time a photograph is sold.  Microstock 
                            images are all royalty free.  
                            <br />

                            <br />
                            <strong>Summary:</strong> Similar to stock photo agencies but they’re more relaxed in many ways, and they work with amateurs.  
                            You will not make much money with Microstock (unless you’re a photography wizard).

                            <strong>Advertising, Design & Related Markets:</strong>  This kind of work is always commercial and your photography is used 
                            to sell services or products.  In order to do this, you need to make appointments to show your portfolio to art directors.  
                            You need to show your buyers that you’re easy to work with, and you’re an amazing photographer.  The book didn’t seem to go 
                            into detail about how to apply, but I would do a lot of research because each of the topics in this category are very vast.

                            <strong>Galleries:</strong> Galleries are not a quick source of income and are more a way of creating a presence as a 
                            photographer (or artist).  In order to be in a gallery, you need extreme quality work.  Galleries typically receive 
                            40-50 percent of the commission.  You may also need to be present in the show.  Make sure you know the kind of gallery 
                            you’re applying to and how the different kinds of galleries work.  In general, reflect on the kind of work you do and where 
                            that work would best be displayed.  Statements you write for you work should be short and sweet.  The book did not seem to 
                            go over how to apply, but I would guess it ranges/changes from gallery to gallery, and you would probably want to write a 
                            query/cover letter and have images ready to give as examples.

                            <strong>Art Fairs:</strong>  Art fairs are a good way to market to an audience that’s looking to buy expensive pieces of work.  
                            You’ll need to have framed and unframed work.  You need to do research first.  After you find a fair that’s a good fit for 
                            you, then visit their website and contact the appropriate person to get more details.  You’ll equipment to protect your work 
                            (a cover for your area, plastic protective sleeves for your photographs, etc.).  In order to apply for an art fair, you might 
                            have to go through a selective process, and some fairs will only allow one display per medium (meaning only one photograph 
                            display, one painting display, etc.).  Art fairs almost always charge fees for you to display your work.
                            <br />
                            <strong>Summary:</strong> Research the fair, have plenty of framed and unframed work, be prepared for fees, and know that 
                            most fairs have a selection process, so your work needs to really stand out.

                            <strong>Contests:</strong>  Contests are a good way to discover how your work compares with the work of other photographers.  
                            Make sure you pay attention to the rights when you submit your images into a contest.  You don’t want to accidentally give 
                            away copy rights.  You may want to view previous images that have won to scope out what style or image typically wins.  
                            Contest very vastly, so do your research.

                        <p>
                            Flâneur is a word used to describe someone who is detached from 
                            society and only wonders about observing the world and never being apart of it.  
                            This term dates back as early as the 16th century, but the meaning didn’t take shape 
                            until the 19th century.  Baudelaire made the term famous by putting it into his essay 
                            “The Painter of Modern Life” in the year 1863.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sontag references this term to explain how photographers interact/perceive the world.  
                            Like the Flâneur we find joy in watching the world go by.  We see what passes, but never 
                            truly experience the world in the same way.  Sontag shares how the Flâneur is often 
                            attracted to the dark and mysterious places of the world instead of the warm and inviting 
                            places everyone seems to know.  We seek to observe the unordinary, but we don’t necessarily 
                            crave to be apart of it.

                                "Camera Work," was a magazine published quarterly by Alfred Stieglitz. His magazine 
                                was known because some of the most prominent and important photographers had their 
                                images featured. The magazine was being published from the years 1903 to 1917.

                            <p>
                                Why did Susan Sontag reference "Camera Work," and Alfred Stieglitz? She mentions 
                                Stieglitz because he was one of the first photographers who stepped away from the 
                                idea that only idealized photographs were beautiful. Stieglitz found beauty in 
                                photographs that weren't the typical "Ansel Adams" landscapes or photographs of 
                                people etc. Stieglitz featured many of the "abnormal" photographs from photographers 
                                that are now famous for their work. Stieglitz would only allow photographs to be 
                                published in his magazine if they showed something beautifully artistic and were 
                                unique, and he would take photographs from someone regardless of their education 
                                (when it came to photography I'm assuming). Some of the photographs featured in 
                                "Camera Work," were taken by James Craig Annan, Clarence White, Fredrick Evans, 
                                Edward Steichen, Frank Eugene, and Alvin Langdon Coburn

                            Lecia is a camera company that was founded in Germany during the year 1914.  
                            The cameras are still around today and are marketed towards photographers who 
                            want complete control over their camera (They don’t have any automatic options 
                            on their cameras even today).  In the book, “On Photography,” Susan Sontag 
                            references Lecia to discuss how photography has become an “equalizer” for every 
                            and anything you could think of.  Page 11 in, “On Photography.”

                                Diane Arbus 1923-1971, was known for her unsettling photos and unusual subjects.  
                                Arbus was appreciated by some for her display of empathy in her photographs.  
                                However, she was also disliked for the belief that she turned unfortunate people 
                                into objects.  Diane Arbus was close and personal with her subjects.  Sontag 
                                referenced Arbus to explain the strange intimacy of photography.  Page 12 in, 
                                “On Photography.”

                                <strong>The movie “Rear Window,”</strong> is about a news photographer stuck inside his apartment after an 
                                accident that puts him in a wheelchair.  The news photographer begins watching his neighbors 
                                to pass the time, but soon realizes that he might be a witness to murder.  Sontag references 
                                the “Rear Window,” to explain how photography is a way to observe and interact with life though 
                                you’re not participating directly.  Though he’s stuck inside his apartment he feels like some 
                                part of his neighbor's life even though he never interacts with them, and most of them don’t 
                                know he exists.  Page 12.
