         <p style="text-indent: 1em;">
          Born and raised in a small town, with two brothers and a sister I quickly 
          developed a love of adventure, and spending time with my family.  My family first became
          aware of my love for photography, when I recieved a camera for christmas around the age of 10.
          I was constantly terroizing my family by taking photographs and videos of them.  Since then, 
          my love of photography has only grown.  On the rare ocassion that I'm not taking photographs,
          or spending time with my friends and family, or working.  
          You'll find in the shop working with wood,
          drawing, writing, or watching my current favorite tv show.
